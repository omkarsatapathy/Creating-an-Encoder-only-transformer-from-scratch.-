# Creating-an-Encoder-only-transformer-from-scratch.-
This repo is consist of a ipynb where an encoder only transformer has been build from scratch. and trained on a kaggle dataset for news classification of a binary class. 

The code used here is mostly inspred from open source. Here I have used a general endocer only transfoemer architecture. 
The dataset consist of roughly 5000+ rows and 2 columns. column 1 contains binary class which later encoded to 0 or 1 respectively. 
I have used first 3500 rows for training and later 1500 for validation perpose. It took around 15 mins to train the loop for 250 epochs on a A100 GPU by google colab. 

Thanks !
